1. Class naming and organization - Classes are namespaced under the packages that they reside in, ie a package cannot contain two classes of the same name, even if they reside in two different .java files, since a java file can contain many classes (but only one public class whose name must be the same as the filename, although a file can contain any number of non-public classes). So, a package can be thought of as a collection, or a unit of organization, of classes instead of .java files.
